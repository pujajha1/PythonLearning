 Q:yeild
 
 it is one of the generator function of python.
 >>> it=[1,2,3,4,5]
>>> i=iter(it)
>>> next(i)
1
>>> next(i)
2
>>> next(i)
3
>>> next(i)
4
>>> next(i)
5
>>> next(i)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
StopIteration

The key feature is that a generator function only runs in response to “next” operations
carried out in iteration. Once a generator function returns, iteration stops. However,
the for statement that’s usually used to iterate takes care of these details, so you don’t
normally need to worry about them

Q:REVERSE

>>> for i in it:print(i)
... 
1
2
3
4
5
>>> for i in reversed(it):print(i)
... 
5
4
3
2
1
>>>
